"""Interfaces for UNIX socket operations with Hyprland's event and command sockets.

Hyprland offers two UNIX sockets:

1. `EventSocket <https://wiki.hyprland.org/IPC/#tmphyprhissocket2sock>`_: This socket broadcasts various events occurring in the Hyprland session, 
   e.g., windows or workspaces getting created or destroyed.
2. `CommandSocket <https://wiki.hyprland.org/IPC/#tmphyprhissocketsock>`_: This socket can be written to in order to influence Hyprland's behavior 
   or send queries about the current state.

Hyprpy uses standard library `sockets <https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html>`_ for socket operations.

Examples:

.. code-block:: python

    from hyprpy import Hyprland

    instance = Hyprland()

    # Connect the socket, wait for an event to occur, print the event data and close the socket.
    instance.event_socket.connect()
    instance.event_socket.wait()
    data = instance.even_socket.read()
    print(data)
    instance.event_socket.close()

    # Send a command
    instance.command_socket.send_command("dispatch", flags=["--single-instance"], args=["exec", "kitty"])
